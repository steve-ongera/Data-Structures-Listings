# C# List Operations Demo

A console application demonstrating fundamental `List<T>` operations in C#, including adding, removing, accessing, and counting elements.

## Overview

This project serves as a practical example of working with generic collections in C#. It showcases common List operations that are essential for .NET developers.

## Features

- **Add Elements**: Dynamically add items to a list
- **Iterate Collections**: Loop through and display all list items
- **Remove Elements**: Delete specific items from the list
- **Index Access**: Retrieve elements by their position
- **Count Items**: Get the total number of elements in the list

## Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (6.0 or higher recommended)
- A C# compatible IDE or text editor

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd fruit-list-demo
```

## Usage

Run the application using the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Expected Output

```
Fruits in the list:
Apple
Banana
Mango

First fruit: Apple
Total fruits: 2
```

## Code Structure

```
Program.cs          # Main application file containing List operations
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Generic Collections (`List<T>`)
- Adding elements with `Add()`
- Removing elements with `Remove()`
- Iterating with `foreach` loops
- Index-based access
- Collection properties (`Count`)
